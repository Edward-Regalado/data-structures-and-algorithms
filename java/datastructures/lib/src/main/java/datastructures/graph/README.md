# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that is used to store data in the form of Vertexes(nodes) and edges.

Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: graph

Challenge Type: New Implementation

## Features

- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:


### Methods

#### add node

- Arguments: value
- Returns: The added node
- Add a node to the graph

#### add edge

- Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- If specified, assign a weight to the edge
- Both nodes should already be in the Graph

#### get nodes

- Arguments: none
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

#### get neighbors

- Arguments: node
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

#### size

- Arguments: none
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
