# Hash Table

- "A hash table is a data structure that is used to store key/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well."

### Methods

#### set

- Arguments: key, value
- Returns: nothing
- This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
- Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.

#### get

- Arguments: key
- Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

#### contains

- Arguments: key
- Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

#### keys

- Returns: Collection of keys

#### hash

- Arguments: key
- Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency
