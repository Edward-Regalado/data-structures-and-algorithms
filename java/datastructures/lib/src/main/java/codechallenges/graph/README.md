# Graph Code Challenges

## Code Challenge: Business Trip

- Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

## Feature Tasks

- Write a function called business trip
- Arguments: graph, array of city names
- Return: cost or null
- Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

### Structure and Testing

- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
- Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

### Example

```
Input	Output
[Metroville: weight($82), Pandora, ]	True, $82
[Arendelle: weight($42), New Monstropolis: weight($74), Naboo]	True, $115
[Naboo, Pandora]	False, $0 (no edges)
[Narnia, Arendelle, Naboo]	False, $0 (no edges)
```
