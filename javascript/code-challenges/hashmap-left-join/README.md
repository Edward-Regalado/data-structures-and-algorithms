# Code Challenge - Hashmap Left Join

- Joins two hashmaps into a single data structure

## Feature Tasks

- Write a function that `LEFT JOINs` two hashmaps into a single data structure.
  - Write a function called left join.
  - Arguments: two hashmaps
    - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
  - Returns: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn't need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic.
