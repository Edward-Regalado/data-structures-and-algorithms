# Code Challenge: Class 07

- Return the kth value from the end of the linked list

## Feature Tasks

### Methods

#### kthFromEnd

- Arguments: a number `k`, as a parameter
- Return the node's value that is `k` places from end of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency

- `kthFromEnd(k)`
  - Time: O(n)
  - Space: O(1)

## Structure and Testing

1. Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
2. Where k and the length of the list are the same
3. Where k is not a positive integer
4. Where the linked list is of a size 1
5. “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
