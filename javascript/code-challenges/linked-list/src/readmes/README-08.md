# Code Challenge: Class 08

- Zip together two linked lists

## Feature Tasks

- write a function call zip lists that zips together two linked list into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and returns a reference to the zipped list.

### Example

- `zipList(ll1, ll2)`
  - Args: ll1: `{ 1 } -> { 3 } -> { 5 } -> null`
  - Args: ll2: `{ 2} -> { 4 } -> { 6 } -> null`
  - Returns: `{ 1 } -> { 2 } -> { 3 } -> { 4 } -> { 5 } ->  { 6 } -> null`

### Methods

#### zipLists

- Arguments: 2 linked lists `ll1` & `ll2`
- Returns: New Linked List, zipped as noted above.

## Approach & Efficiency

- `zipLists(list1, list2)`
  - Time: O(n)
  - Space: O(n)

## Structure and Testing

- write tests for any cases that help you ensure your code is working as expected.
