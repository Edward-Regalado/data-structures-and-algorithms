# Code Challenge 31: Hashmap Tree Intersection

Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your **data-structures-and-algorithms** public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.

### Challenge Setup & Execution

Branch Name: hashmap-tree-intersection

#### Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

### Feature Tasks

Find all values found to be in 2 binary trees

- Write a function called tree intersection
- Arguments: two binary trees
- Return: array

### Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

### Example

Input: BinaryTree1 BinaryTree2

Output [100,160,125,175,200,350,500]

### Stretch Goals

Presume you are working with BSTs. How can you improve the performance of your algorithm?

### Requirements

Ensure your complete solution follows the standard requirements.

1. Write unit tests
2. Follow the template for a well-formatted README
3. Submit the assignment following these instructions
