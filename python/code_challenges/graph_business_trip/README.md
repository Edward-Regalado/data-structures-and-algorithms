# Code Challenge: Graph Busines Trip

Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

### Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your data-structures-and-algorithms public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README  file.

### Challenge Setup & Execution

Branch Name: graph-business-trip

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Feature Tasks

- Write a function called business trip
- Arguments: graph, array of city names
- Return: cost or null
- Determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
